For these tutorials, we assume that you have successfully installed all
the requirements and have been able to run the server.

Following is the tutorial:

1.  After successfully unpacking the extension in Chrome, just visit the
    page you want to copy the data from and open the extension. Here we
    have visited Wikipedia.org. Make sure to enable the extension by
    toggling the right switch on the top right corner.
